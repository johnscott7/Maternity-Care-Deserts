# Maternity-Care-Deserts
A project exploring how the erosion of maternity care access from 2010-present has impacted maternal and perinatal health outcomes across US counties

The United States has maternal mortality rates two to three times higher than those of other high-income nations. Several factors are suspected to contribute to this crisis, including hospital closures, Medicaid coverage gaps, abortion restrictions, and the growing number of “maternal care deserts”.  The steady decline in maternity care access across the country is an issue that remains poorly understood yet well-documented, making it a strong topic for data analysis. 
This project will explore the following questions: How has the erosion of maternity care access over the past 10-15 years affected maternal and perinatal health outcomes across counties and states in the United States? I will map the national decline in maternity care access, quantify associations between access loss and maternal morbidity, prenatal care timing, and infant outcomes, and identify high-risk counties and socioeconomic correlations.
Understanding these patterns is critical for health systems and policymakers working to reduce inequities in maternal care. Health systems and state agencies need to know which communities are being left behind, and this study will aim to identify the geographic areas most affected by declining access.
Note: I have some concerns this is leaning toward more of a research project and less of a data-driven analysis, and also some concerns about access to county-level data (as compared to more readily available state-level data that does not pair as well with the primary dataset) and as a result have added a second business issue below.
